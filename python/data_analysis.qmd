**Why is Python so widely used in data analysis?**

The rich ecosystem of libraries and tools specifically designed for data analysis is indeed the primary reason why Python is widely used in data analysis. Python's popularity in this field is largely driven by the availability and quality of these libraries, which provide powerful and efficient solutions for various aspects of data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and many others offer comprehensive functionalities that cover a wide range of data analysis tasks. These libraries are developed and maintained by dedicated teams of developers and have become essential tools for data analysts, scientists, and researchers worldwide.
