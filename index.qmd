title: "Quarto Website"
---

This is a Quarto website project.

The idea of this website is to present the final project carried out for the "**Machine Learning and Neural Networks**" course. You can also find and study the theoretical bases necessary to understand how the project was developed.

The entire website design is inspired in [albertprofe wiki](albertprofe.dev) (thanks Albert! you are the best!)
